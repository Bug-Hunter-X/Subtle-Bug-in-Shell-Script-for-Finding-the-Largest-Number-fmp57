This repository contains a shell script with a subtle bug. The script aims to find the largest number in a list, but it incorrectly uses string comparison instead of numerical comparison.  The `bug.sh` file demonstrates the flawed logic.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.sh`, correctly performs numerical comparison to find the largest number.  The README provides a description of the bug and its solution.
